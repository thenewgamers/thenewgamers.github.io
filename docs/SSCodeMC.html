<p style="font-size: 28-px";>Some ideas for your home:</p>

    <br>
1.	Bed – A bed is a must, because it sets your respawn point and lets you skip the night <img src="Image Sources/BedMC.png" width="150" height="100"><br>
2.	Crafting Table – Lets you build all sorts of stuff, very important to make things.<br>
3.	Furnace – Smelt items, very important.<br>
4.	Chests – Stores extra items/loot you don’t want to loose, and can store junk which you don't want to carry around.<br>
5.	Enchanting Table – Enchants items to make them more powerful.<img src="Image Sources/EnchantmentTableNew.png" width="100" height="100"><br>
6.	Blast furnace – smelts your ores fast.<br>
7.	Smoker – Makes your food faster.<br>
8.	Anvil – Rename/enchant with enchanted books.<br>
9.	A Mine – lets you get materials like diamonds.<br>
10.	Brewing Stand – Very useful in later stages of the game, but not necessary.<br>
11.	Cauldron – Goes with brewing stand, use to store water to start your potions.<br>
12.	Infinite Water source – Make one to get infinite water.<br>
13.	Beacon – Lets you have special effects.<br>
14.	Armor Stands – Just a cool touch to your house.<img src="Image Sources/ArmorStand.png" width="50" height="125"><br>
15.	Smithing Tables – A must for Netherite things.<br>
FARM:<br>
1.	Wheat – Very important for making lots of things, such as bread. Plus, most animals need wheat to reproduce.<img src="Image Sources/Wheat.jfif" width="100" height="100"><br>
2.	Potatoes – Baked potatoes are underrated and are actually quite good. Plus poisonous potatoes are good for trolling noobs.<br>
3.	Carrots – A very fast food source, plus they breed pigs.<br>
4.	Beetroot – Not very useful, but used for soup which is quite good.<br>
5.	Melon – A thing you could use for food, but probably you want to use them to make glistering melons, to make healing potions.<br>
6.	Pumpkin – Pumpkin pie is extremely good food.<img src="Image Sources/PumpkinPie.png" width="100" height="100"><br>
7.	Cocoa Beans – Use these to make brown dye and cookies, and cookies craft in large numbers.<img src="Image Sources/Cocoa.jfif" width="100" height="60"><br>
8.	Bamboo – Usually for decoration, but also used to make scaffolding. Grows extremely fast. <br>
9.	Nether Wart - The base ingredient for all potions, but not acquired unless you visit the nether.<img src="Image Sources/Nether_Wart.png" width="50" height="50"><br>
10.	Chorus Fruit - You can use this to make end rods and to rescue yourself when you're falling through the void. But you need to go to the endcity, so this is probably the hardest plant to acquire in the game.</p>
